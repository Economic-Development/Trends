# Community Situation

Many people live at blocks distance from thei office. It takes them 1 minute per block to the office and around 20 seconds per bloc by bike.
If it takes them various minutes more to walk to office than to ride thaen how many blocks distance do they travel to their offices?

# Analysis 

As it takes a couple of minutes more thatn on the bike, people walk 1 minute per block and ride more blocks in 60 seconds 
which leads to the need to find the difference between number of blocks and the actual ride mintes.

# Conclusions 

* People are between 10-24 minutes away of their work but is matters more how they rech it. 
* It is clear that riding the bike halfs the time to get to work because in les seconds riding the bike covers more blocks thatn walking
* Charts show that while some get to work in 18 minutes walking, bike riders do it in 12 minutes 
* Thursday has the highest bike minutes than any other day in the week.

# Solutions

Since we're talking about neighbourhood and relatively small distances:
* Draw map shortcuts and encourage people to use those shortcuts, including those who prefer walking 
* Build bike parks (rent, parking bikes etc.)
